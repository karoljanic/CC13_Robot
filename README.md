# CC13_Robot
This is a robot project modeled on BB8. 
The construction is modelled in Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed using 3D printing technology. I currently use Creality Ender 3. 
The electronics is based on the STM21F1038C and self-made PCB / Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense processor. 
The robot is controlled by a mobile app via Bluetooth. It is developed in Android Studio. 
Work still in progress.
